**What is Emergency Response Plan?**
This emergency response plan has been developed for the company to comply with standards. It will be used in all emergency situations which may occur in any Company/Industry. Generally this plan will cover emergencies such as fires, medical emergencies, accidents, catastrophes, toxic releases like refrigeration malfunctions resulting in the real or potential release of anhydrous ammonia, and other emergency situations requiring the orderly evacuation of this facility and/or activation of our plant ERP team. This plan does not apply to small leaks and mishaps which can be successfully covered under the plant's written Emergency Response Plan.The key points of a Emergency Response Plan response are that partial or total plant evacuation is not necessary and employees in the immediate work area of the spill or mishap can safely handle the situation. The written Emergency Response Plan and employee training must be very clear to allow all employees to recognize when a spill or mishap requires emergency response versus local response under the hazard communication program. 

This plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary. 

A full evacuation drill covering all facility employees will be held on the first business day of every odd month. This drill frequency is necessary due to the significant employee turnover rate in production departments. 

The plant manager is responsible for the update, implementation, and drill/incident critique of this plan.
 
All new employees will be thoroughly instructed in this plan before they begin their initial work assignments and told where the plan will be kept. An up-to date copy of the plan is kept in a place that is easily accessible to all employees
