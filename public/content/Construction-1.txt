3. Traffic and Pedestrian Arrangement

The first step is a suitable and sufficient risk assessment. Ask such questions as 'What might go wrong and why?', 'Could people be struck or run over?' and 'Could they lose balance and fall while loading and unloading?'

3.1 Risk Assessment Process

- Identify the hazards associated with activities involving workplace vehicles, e.g. reversing operations, loading and unloading
- Identify who might be harmed by each hazard. This is likely to include drivers and other workers, and may also include visitors and the public
- Evaluate the risks for each hazard and the likelihood of the harm and its severity. Are existing precautions adequate or should more be done?
- Set priorities for action and implementation
- Review the risk assessment periodically, especially when there are changes, e.g. new vehicles, changes of traffic routes

3.2 Collective Measures

To start with, consider collective measures to eliminate risks, such as:
- Improved design and layout of the workplace to minimize transport accidents
- Signs to be used as a secondary measure where risks cannot be eliminated

3.3 System of Work

Maintain a system of work by:
- Avoiding the need for reversing by better layout design
- Using a safe system of work for reversing
- Ensuring a safe system of work for loading and unloading vehicles
- Checking to see if the layout of routes is appropriate for vehicle and pedestrian activities
- Segregating pedestrian and vehicle traffic routes if feasible
- Posting adequate warnings in conspicuous places
- Ensuring suitable pedestrian crossing points on vehicle routes
- Introducing a one-way traffic system, if possible, to reduce the risk of head-on collision
- Checking to see if vehicle traffic routes are suitable for the types and flow of vehicles that use them
- Keeping all floor and road surfaces in good condition
- Removing obstructions or otherwise, making sure they are clearly visible
- Avoiding sharp bends in road layouts
- Providing suitable fixed mirrors at blind corners

3.4 Additional Measures

Other measures should also be considered:
- Suitable direction, speed limit and priority signs

- Store gasoline and other flammable liquids in a safety can in a ventilated place or an approved storage facility
- Ensure that leaks or spills of flammable or combustible materials are cleaned up promptly

6. Welfare and Toilet Facilities

6.1 Planning Considerations

Welfare and toilet facilities need to be considered in both the pre-tender and construction phases as part of the health and safety plan.

Matters to be considered when planning the welfare and toilet facilities include:
- The work to be carried out and the health risks associated with it
- The duration and spread of the site locations
- The number of people working at different locations
- The distance from rest places and welfare facilities

Welfare facilities also include washing facilities, changing areas, drinking water and eating facilities. In addition, regular maintenance and cleaning will be required, e.g. sewer maintenance work may require the provision of additional washing and changing facilities because of its obnoxious nature.

6.2 Toilet Facilities

Fixed installation:
1. At the site base, usually near the site office
2. At different satellite locations, especially when the coverage of worksite is wide and far from the base
3. Portable installation on the worksite

6.3 Washing Facilities

At suitable positions:
- Hand basins or bowls
- Water tap with buckets or receptacles
- Shower or eye-bath where necessary

6.4 Rest Areas

Fixed installation:
- At the site base location
- At different satellite locations
- Temporary installations on the worksite

7. Site Safety Cycle

The "Site Safety Cycle" arrangement is modeled on the Japanese practice of "Safety Work Cycle" which encourages active participation of, and communication among, site staff at all levels with a view to promoting safety and tidiness of construction sites. It is done through a so-called '5-S' system.

The term "5-S" comes from a formal system created by the Japanese and adapted by many companies in Hong Kong. The 5 steps in Japanese are Seiri, Seiton, Seison, Seiketsu and Shitsuke. It is a set of principles and methodology of organization and standardization that goes well beyond normal housekeeping programmes, and sets the foundation for upkeeping and improving the work environment.

7.1 What '5-S' Means

What '5-S' means (directly translated from Japanese) is:
1. Organisation (Seiri)
2. Neatness (Seiton)
3. Cleaning (Seiso)
4. Standardisation (Seiketsu)
5. Discipline (Shitshke)

8. Controlling Risks

To control risks in construction work is a complex task. It is often underestimated and simply treated as common sense. In order to address the problem effectively, the Health and Safety Executive, U.K. suggests a 5-step approach:

8.1 Five-Step Risk Control Approach

1. **STEP 1:** Look for the hazards
2. **STEP 2:** Decide who might be harmed and how
3. **STEP 3:** Evaluate the risks and decide whether the existing precautions are adequate or whether more should be done
4. **STEP 4:** Record your findings
5. **STEP 5:** Review your assessment and revise it if necessary

9. Electricity Safety

9.1 Overview

Workers engaged in construction work are frequently exposed to electric currents in various forms from overhead cables, underground supply lines, to electrical installations and tools. In fact, they are exposed to electrical energy in their daily work. Shocks and electrocutions can occur to workers engaged in different types of jobs.

Many workers are unaware of the potential electrical hazards present in their work environment, which makes them even more vulnerable to the danger of electrocution. Others are being too ignorant to believe that electrocution is only too remote because very often they only receive minor electric shock or burns from arcing and flashover.

Many of these workers are experienced electricians. They customarily take short-cuts by working on live apparatus without rendering the circuit dead or awaiting a permit to work in order to save time.

9.2 Types of Electrical Injuries

Electrical injuries in worksites consist of four main types:
1. Electrocution (fatal)
2. Electric shock
3. Burns
4. Falls caused by contact with electric current

9.3 General Precautions

- Prohibit work on new and existing live circuits until all power is shut off and a positive permit to work system is in place
- Do not use worn electrical cords or cables
- Use only 3-wire type extension cords
- Maintain all electrical tools and equipment in safe condition and check regularly for defects
- Remove broken or damaged tools and equipment from the jobsite
- Protect all temporary power (including extension cords) with circuit protection device
- Do not bypass any protection system or device designed to protect employees from contact with electrical current
- Locate and identify overhead electrical power lines. Make sure that ladders, scaffolds, equipment or materials never come into close proximity of electrical power lines

9.4 Safe Work Practices

Control electrical hazards through safe work practices:
- Plan your work and plan for safety
- Avoid wet working conditions and other dangers
- Avoid overhead power cables
- Use proper wiring and connectors
- Use and maintain tools properly
- Wear suitable personal protective equipment

9.5 Electrical Safety Controls

Control contact with electrical voltages and control electrical currents to create a safe work environment:
1. Prepare a permit-to-work system
2. Prevent overloading by using the right type of wiring
3. Prevent exposure to live electrical parts by isolation or rendering the circuit dead
4. Prevent exposure to live wirings and parts by using insulation
5. Prevent shocks by suitable earthing
6. Prevent shocks by using suitable earth leakage detection device
7. Prevent overloading by using overcurrent protection device

9.6 Lockout/Tagout Procedures

To prevent injuries and deaths of workers working with hazardous electrical energy in worksites:
- Develop and implement a safe system of work
- Identify and display suitable warning signs
- De-energize, isolate, block, and/or release all forms of hazardous electrical energy before work begins
- Plan and implement a permit-to-work system
- Require that each lock used to secure an energy control device be clearly labeled with durable tags to identify the worker assigned to the lock
- Make sure that the worker who installs a lock is the one who removes it after all work has been completed
- If work is not completed when the shift changes, workers arriving on shift should apply their locks before departing workers remove their locks
- Verify by test and/or observation that all energy sources are de-energized before work begins
- Inspect repair work before reactivating the equipment
- Make sure that all workers are clear of danger points before re-energizing the system
- Train all workers in the basic concepts of electrical safety
- Establish a control program with all entry to confined space

9.7 Common Electrical Hazards

Plants and materials frequently come into contact with electrical transmission lines or cables:
- Derricks and cranes
- Excavators
- Projected metal building materials
- Metal ladders
- Scaffolds

9.8 Avoiding Contact Injuries

To avoid the chance of injuries:
- Look for overhead and buried transmission lines or cables
- Post suitable warning signs
- Contact power utility company for buried transmission cable locations and keep a safe distance away
- Until verified and render dead, assume that all overhead transmission cables are live
- Use non-conductive ladders when working near power transmission lines
- Provide suitable training and information to plants operators and workers

9.9 Ground Fault Protection

Lack of ground fault protection:
Due to the dynamic, rugged nature of construction work, normal use of electrical equipment at worksites can quickly cause wear and tear that results in insulation breakdown, short-circuits and exposed wires. If there is no leakage protection, these can cause a short circuit that send current through the worker's body, resulting in electric burns, explosions, fire, or death.

To avoid the chance of injuries:
- Use leakage protection circuit breakers
- Follow manufacturer's recommended testing procedure to ensure circuit breakers are working correctly
- Use double insulated tools and equipment with clear and distinctive markings
- Use tools and equipment according to the manufacturer's' instructions
- Visually inspect all electrical equipment before use
- Remove from service any equipment with frayed cords, missing ground prongs, cracked tool casings, etc.
- Apply a warning tag to any defective tool and do not use it until the problem has been corrected

9.10 Proper Equipment Use

Improper use of equipment:
If electrical equipment is used in ways for which it is not designed, you can no longer depend on the safety features built in by the manufacturer. This may damage your equipment and cause employee injuries.

To avoid the chance of injuries:
- Use only equipment that is approved
- Use all equipment according to the manufacturer's instructions
- Do not modify cords or use them incorrectly

9.11 Extension and Flexible Cords

Improper use of extension and flexible cords:
The normal wear and tear on extension and flexible cords at your site can loosen or expose wires, creating hazardous conditions. Cords that are not three-wire type, not designed for heavy-duty-usage, or that have been modified, will increase the risk of contacting electrical current.

To avoid the chance of injuries:
- Use factory-assembled cord sets
- Use only extension cords that are three-wire type
- Use only extension cords that are designated for the purpose of use, e.g. weather proof, flameproof, etc.
- Provide proper training in handling cords and advise workers never pull the plugs from receptacles by the cords
- Check all cords on-site before use. Report any cords where signs of wear and tear or makeshift modifications on any parts are found. Take away all such cords from service immediately
