CRANE SAFETY 
Introduction: 
A crane is a tower or derrick that is equipped with cables and pulleys that are used to lift and lower material. They are commonly used in the construction industry and in the manufacturing of heavy equipment. Cranes for construction are normally temporary structures, either fixed to the ground or mounted on a purpose built vehicle. 
They can either be controlled from an operator in a cab that travels along with the crane, by a push button pendant control station, or by radio type controls. The crane operator is ultimately responsible for the safety of the crews and the crane.

Lifting Safety:

Lifting equipment is any work equipment for lifting and lowering loads, and includes any accessories used in doing so (such as attachments to support, fix or anchor the equipment). There are three key terms used in reference to the Regulations: 'lifting equipment’; ‘lifting operations'; and 'the load'.

Rigging:

This handbook serves as a workplace safety and health resource for workers who are involved in work activities involving lifting equipment such as cranes. The Rigger and Signalman handbook highlights general safety pointers to ensure safe lifting operations. This handbook was developed to assist the Rigger and Signalman to better understand their roles and responsibilities, show examples of good and bad practices for loading and rigging, perform basic inspection of lifting equipments such as hooks, shackles and wire ropes, adhere to good communication practices, and recognise crane hand signals.
This handbook is produced for education and informational purposes by the National Crane Safety Taskforce and Workplace 
 Safety and Health Council and serves as a reference for 
 good practices.
