Indian Occupational H & S Legal - 1 
 
Constitutional Framework:

Under the Constitution of India, labour is a subject in the concurrent list where both the Central and the State Governments are competent to enact legislation subject to certain matters reserved for the Central Government.  The Constitution of India provides detailed provisions for the rights of the citizens and also lays down the principles in the governance of the country called as “Directive Principles of State Policy”.  These Directive Principles provide for securing the safety and health and strength of employees, men and women, that the tender age of children are not abused, that citizens are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age or strength (Article 39), just and humane conditions of work and maternity relief are provided (Article 42),  that the Government shall take steps, by suitable legislation or in any other way, to secure the participation of employee in the management of enterprises, establishments or other organizations engaged in any industry (Article 43A),  for ensuring that no child below the age of 14 is employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment (Article 24).  Occupational Safety and Health is one of the subjects allotted to Ministry of Labour & Employment under the Government of India Allocation of Business Rules. The Industrial Safety and Health branch of the Ministry discharges the overall functions relating to policy decisions and laying down guidelines for countrywide adoption of legislation.

National Policy on Safety, Health and Environment at Workplace (NPSHEW):

On the basis of Directive Principles as well as international instruments the Government of India, Ministry of Labour & Employment, had declared the National Policy on Safety, Health and Environment at Workplace (NPSHEW) on 20th February, 2009 and the policy document has been posted in the website of the Ministry of Labour and Employment and DGFASLI at www.labour.nic.in and www.dgfasli.nic.in respectively.  The purpose of this National Policy is to establish a preventive safety and health culture in the country through elimination of the incidents of work related injuries, diseases, fatalities, disasters and to enhance the well being of employees in all the sectors of economic activity in the country. 
 
The salient features of the Policy are as below:-  

It recognizes safe and healthy working environment as a fundamental human right.

It aims at enhancing the well-being of the employees and the society at large by eliminating work related injuries, diseases, etc.

It enumerates the goals to be achieved and brings into focus the objective of continuous reduction in the incidence of work related injuries and diseases.  


Major OSH Laws & Regulations:  
On the basis of these Directive Principles and international instruments, the Government of India declares its policy, priorities, strategies and purposes through the exercise of its power.  The Government of India has enacted the statutes relating to Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) at workplaces.  At present, comprehensive safety and health statutes for regulating Occupational Safety and Health at workplaces mainly exist in respect of the four sectors namely, manufacturing, mining, ports, and construction.  There are four main legislations that cover Occupational Safety and Health at workplace.

(i) The Factories Act, 1948 , covering factories wherein the enforcement of safety at workplace is by the Chief Inspector of Factories in the respective states,

(ii) The Mines Act, 1952 and Mines Rules, 1955 for mining industry where the enforcement is by the Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS) under Ministry of Labour & Employment , Government of India, 

(iii) The Dock Workers (Safety, Health and Welfare) Act, 1986 followed by notification of the Dock Workers (Safety, Health and Welfare) Regulations, 1990 dealing with the major ports of India and the enforcement is by the Directorate General of Factory Advice Service & Labour Institutes (DGFASLI), under Ministry of Labour & Employment , Government of India, and

(iv) The Building &  Other Construction Workers (Regulations of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996 , covering construction workers at construction sites wherein the enforcement is by the Directorate General Labour Welfare in the central sphere and by the Labour Commissioners/Factory Inspectorates in the States/UTs.

The Factories Act, 1948:

The First Factories Act in India was passed in 1881. Though this legislation was initiated to promote the interest of the producers in Lancashire and Manchester in United Kingdom, it has since then steadily developed into a welfare measure of wide contents and coverage through innumerable amendments and re-enactments. As observed by the Supreme Court of India in the case of Nagpur Electric Light and Power Company the scope of the factory legislation has been now very much enlarged in order to secure health, safety, welfare, proper working hours, leaves, working conditions and benefits for the workers employed in factories.
 
Under the present Act factory means any premises in which 10 or more workers are working and a manufacturing process is carried on with the aid of power; any premises in which 20 or more workers are working and a manufacturing process is carried on without the aid of power. Recently this definition has undergone change in some of the states of India where under the Act, factory means any premises in which 20 or more workers are working and a manufacturing process is carried on with the aid of power; any premises in which 40 or more workers are working and a manufacturing process is carried on without the aid of power. Chapter II of the Act deals with The Inspection Staff, Chapter III of the Act deals with Health and Chapter IV deals with Safety. 
 

Chapter IV A (Provisions Relating to Hazardous Processes) was added to the present Act  in 1988 {after the Bhopal Gas Tragedy on the night of 2-3 December 1984 at the Union Carbide India Limited pesticide plant in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh wherein over 500,000 people were exposed to methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas and other chemicals.} with:

 Dock Workers (Safety, Health & Welfare) Act, 1986 & The Dock Workers (Safety, Health & Welfare) Regulations, 1990

Considering the hazardous nature of dock work, the ILO as early as in 1929 adopted an international convention to protect dock workers against accidents.  This convention was revised in 1932.  The history of safety legislation of dock workers in India dates back to 1934 where the Indian Dock Labourers Act, 1934 was enacted to give effect to this ILO Convention viz., "Protection Against Accidents (Dockers) Convention (Revised), 1932 (No.32)".  The main objective of the Act was to make the working places and working procedures safe.  Due to the Second World War, the Indian Dock Labourers Regulation, 1948 framed under the Act could be brought into force in the year 1948 only.  The Act and the Regulations were limited in scope as they covered only safety aspects and that too for workers employed on board and alongside the ships and thus a large number of workers engaged in other areas of the ports such as transit sheds, warehouses, yards etc., were not covered.  As the necessity arose to include health and welfare provisions, the Dock Workers (Safety, Health and Welfare)) Scheme, 1961 was framed under the Dock Workers (Regulation of Employment) Act, 1948 to cover the rest of the workers working elsewhere in the port premises. 

In order to ratify the ILO Conventions 152 and also to implement the recommendation of the National Commission on Labour, a unified Act, viz., the Dock Workers (Safety, Health and Welfare) Act, 1986 was enacted and the detailed Dock Workers (Safety, Health and Welfare) Regulations were framed in 1990.  The enforcement of the Act and the Regulations is carried out by the Inspectorates Dock Safety functioning in all the major ports under the administrative control of the Director General, DGFASLI, Ministry of Labour, Government of India. The Director General, DGFASLI as Chief Inspector of Dock Safety is also responsible for enforcement of the Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals Rules, 1989 framed under the Environment (Protection) Act 1996 in the Major Ports. 

The Dock Workers (Safety, Health and Welfare) Regulations, 1990 was framed under the Section 20 of the Dock Workers (Safety, Health and Welfare) Act, 1986.  Regulations 9 to 94 in Part III of the Dock Workers(Safety, Health and Welfare)Regulations, 1990 are covering safety aspects in the working places, warehouses and storage places, decks and Hatch ways etc., Lifting Appliances and Gear, Transport Equipment and Operations, Handling of Cargo, Handling of Dangerous Goods, Freight Container Terminals, Miscellaneous.  Regulations 95 to 99 in Part IV of the Dock Workers (Safety, Health and Welfare) Regulations, 1990 are covering health aspects like cleanliness, drinking water, latrines and urinals, spittoons, ventilation and temperature in dock area including reefer holds on ships. Regulations 100 to 109 in Part V of the Dock Workers (Safety, Health and Welfare)Regulations, 1990 are covering welfare facilities like washing facilities, First-Aid boxes, ambulance room, ambulance carriage, stretchers, shelters or rest rooms and lunch rooms, canteens, medical examination of dock workers, notices, welfare officers.

The Mines Act, 1952 and other laws pertaining to Mines:

In earlier years when mining activities were modest in scale, safety problems too were simple. With the progress in exploitation of minerals, safety of persons employed became a matter of concern. In 1895, the Government of India initiated steps to frame legislative measures for safety of workmen. In 1897 first major disaster in mining hit the Kolar Gold Fields killing 52 persons, to be soon followed by the Khost Coal Mine disaster in Balochistan (now in Pakistan) killing 47 persons. The disaster hastened the process of formulation of safety laws and the first Mines Act was enacted in 1901. With further experience, this Act was superseded by the Indian Mines Act, 1923, which was again replaced by the present Mines Act, 1952 with amendments in 1959. On 27 Dec 1975 the Chasnala mining disaster occurred in a coal mine in Chasnala near Dhanbad in the Indian state of Bihar now called Jharkhand, when an explosion in the mine followed by flooding of water killed 372 miners. The roof of coal caved in resulting in 7 million imperial gallons (32,000 m3) of water per minute flooding into the mine. The miners were trapped under a mountain of debris and drowned when the water surged into the mine. The Indian Iron and Steel Company (IISCO), which owned the mine, said it conformed to international standards. A Hindi film Kala Pathar depicting the tragedy was also produced. Major changes were incorporated in this Act in 1983. The Mines Act, 1952 applies to mines of all minerals within the country except the State of Sikkim, including the offshore mines within the limits of territorial water. For administering the provisions of the Indian Mines Act, 1901, the Government of India set up a "Bureau of Mines Inspection" on the 7th January 1902 with headquarters at Calcutta. The name of the organisation was changed to Department of Mines in 1904 and its headquarters shifted to Dhanbad in 1908. On 1.1.1960, the organization was renamed as "Office of the Chief Inspector of Mines". Since 1.5.1967, the office has been re-designated as Directorate-General of Mines Safety (DGMS in short).

The Mines Act, 1952 deals with the matters relating to safety, health and welfare of persons employed in mines including oil mines. The Act specifies the provisions for regulating employment of persons, leave with wages, duties and responsibilities of owner, agent and manager, drinking water, First-Aid and rest shelters, medical examinations and occupational health surveys, notice of accidents and occupational diseases in addition to framing of rules, regulations and byelaws on specific subjects including the penalty provisions for violations of this Act.
