**Climate Safety:**

**Monsoon:**
Prior to the onset of rains, following checks should be carried out to prevent hazards that could result into personal injury, property damage or delays:

**General Monsoon Precautions:**
Cleaning of all drains in and around project site and labor camp.
Backfilling of unwanted pits and barricading, shoring / benching & regular de-watering in all balance pits where work is going on.
Repair of approaches to site offices, stores and storage yards etc., if required. 
Rain protection during welding / gas cutting.
Stacking of material over sleepers.
Safe approaches for cranes, vehicles etc.
Restrict erection work at heights.
Ensure daily check for stability of scaffoldings before commencement of work.
Arrange tarpaulin to protect the material at site.
Proper and safe storage arrangements for fuel / oil drums.
All PPE's and tools to be stored in a dry place.
Adequate materials for monsoon repair work etc.
Cover the motors, gears, wire rope drums of cranes / hoists.
Procure antidote for poisonous insects / snake bite.
Maintain adequate medicines at the first aid center.
Carry out de-fogging / spray of DDT etc. through local authorities to prevent spread of any epidemic.
Inform all drivers / operators for not moving closer to the excavated area.
Tell all to avoid using slippery roads, if unavoidable, use with utmost care.
Provide rest place for workers during rain.
Ensure wind ties / anchoring of roofs, wherever required.  

**Electrical Monsoon Precautions:**
Check for water accumulation around electrical installation like meter room, main distribution board, DG sheds, etc., if required elevate the level for safer approach.
Caution all for keeping away from any installation in or near meter room if the wall is wet.
Strengthen all sub-distribution boards (DB) with props / anchors.
Inspect installed ELCB & check earth resistance continuously.
Ensure all temporary DB’s are provided with proper earthing & ensure continuity of earthing loop to all DB’s.  
Provide shed / cover over all distribution & sub-distribution boards.
Check all the temporary joints and make them waterproof to the extent possible and never allow any temporary joint in water.
Poles installed for overhead cabling - make them rigid / more stable.
Provide glass cover for Halogen fittings for avoiding water entry.
Avoid / arrest water leakage in all offices / buildings as this may cause electrical faults / short-circuit in the electrical system.
Provide lightning arrester on tower cranes.
Only licensed / authorized electricians shall handle live electric wires, switches or connections. While carrying out repair work, a rubber mat will be used by all electricians.
All poles should be well driven into ground to prevent these falling down due to wet and loose earth.

**Height Work Monsoon Precautions:**
All height work to be stopped in severe windy conditions
Anemometer to be installed for chimney work / structural erection above 30 mtrs. Work shall be stopped if the wind velocity crosses 30km / hr. 

**Flooding at Site/Labour Camp Monsoon Precautions:​**
Provision of additional / stand - by pumps to drain out flood water from site / labor camp.
Electric supply must be switched off in flooded area immediately.
Additional adequate measures shall be taken in case of flooding at site / labor camp.

**Labour Camp Monsoon Precautions:**
Prevent contamination of drinking water.
Ensure collection and disposal of food waste & garbage regularly.
Secure all loose G. I. Sheets to prevent from flying off in case of stormy & gusty wind.
Ensure proper earthing to G. I. Sheet partition with effective functioning of ELCB’s.
All temporary electric connections must be rooted through 30 mA cut off rating ELCB.
Ensure all wires / cables are not laid on sharp edges OR through a hole within the G. I. Sheet as to prevent damage to insulation. If, possible route through conduit pipes and support wire / cables by suitable hook.
Ensure all wire / cable joints are water and shock proof to prevent from shock. 
Sites may take other additional actions to suit their site conditions.
