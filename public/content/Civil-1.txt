**Civil Safety Guidelines - Numbered Lines**

**What is Civil Safety?**

1. The most common form of injury in the civil construction industry is sprains and strains which accounted for 62.5 percent of injuries in 1995-96.
2. Approximately half of these injuries are back injuries caused by muscular stress while handling objects.
3. Open wounds, and fractures and dislocations caused by hitting moving objects are the next most commonly reported injuries.
