**Fire Classes:**

â€‹Fire are classified in many ways as per regions,

**Class A:** Fires involving ordinary combustible materials, such as paper, wood, and textile fibres, where a cooling, blanketing, or wetting extinguishing agent is needed.

**Class B:** Fires involving flammable liquids such as gasoline, thinners, oil-based paints and greases. Extinguishers for this type of fire include carbon dioxide, dry chemical* and halogenated agent types.  

**Class C:** Fires involving energized electrical equipment, where a non-conducting gaseous clean agent or smothering agent is needed. The most common type of extinguisher for this class is a carbon dioxide extinguisher.

**Class D:** Fires involving combustible metals such as magnesium, sodium, potassium, titanium, and aluminium. Special dry powder extinguishing agents are required for this class of fire, and must be tailored to the specific hazardous metal.

**Class F:** Fires involving commercial cooking appliances with vegetable oils, animal oils, or fats at high temperatures. A wet potassium acetate, low pH-based agent is used for this class of fire.
