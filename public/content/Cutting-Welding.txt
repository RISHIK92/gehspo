**General Steps for Cutting with an Oxygen/Acetylene Torch:**
1. When attaching gauges to cylinders, use care not to over tighten them.
2. Generally, the desired pressure for the acetylene gauge should never exceed 7-8 pounds unless a heating tip is used.
3. The desired pressure for the oxygen gauge should need not exceed 35-40 pounds up to a number 2 tip. Increase about 10 pounds per size number increase.
4. Never use a cigarette lighter to light a torch, ONLY USE A STRIKER
5. Anytime the torch will be used, proper PPE is required. Never use sunglasses to burn with because they are not the proper shade and will cause damage to the eyes.  Minimum shade of burning goggles should be #5 green shade.  Leather welding gloves should always be worn.  These two items are always necessary but other accessories such as leather sleeves, ribs, spats, and other protective leather may be worn for comfort as well as safety.

**Safety in Welding**
Introduction Welding and related thermal processes utilize compressed gas and/or electric current to provide a concentrated heat source which melts or burns away steel and other metals. Proper safety precautions are required to avoid accidents related to the gas and power supplies, to the sparks, heat, fumes, and visible and invisible rays from the heat source.
