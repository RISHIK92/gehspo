**What is Noise and Noise Pollution?**

​The word noise is derived from the Latin term nausea. Noise has been defined as a sound without agreeable quality or as unwanted or undesirable sound. This is a subjective definition as some desirable sound for somebody (fast music) may be noise for some other person. So defining it in a better way we can say that noise is wrong sound in the wrong place at the wrong time. A given sound is pleasant when soft but noisy when loud. It may be acceptable for a short time but unacceptable when prolonged. It may be intriguing when rhythmic but noise when randomly repeated. Noise is defined in law as, excessive, offensive, persistent or startling sound. Like air and water pollution noise is also emerging fast as a major pollutant to the environment. The roar of jet planes, honking of buses, the screeching of rushing vehicles, wailing of emergency vehicle sirens, whistling of railway engines, back fire from motor vehicles, the din of factories, the thunder of construction machinery, are contributing to the high level of noise. The noise is just not confined to the urban area but the countryside is also being shaken by the rattle of motorized farm implements, pump sets, tractors, and buzzing of motor vehicles etc. Along with these the increasing use of televisions, sound systems and loudspeakers without any check on their volume is also contributing to the growing noise levels. Noise problem can be divided in two categories. First is the community noise wherein one is concerned with annoyance caused to people in their indoor environment. It is the intrusion of noise inside the dwellings above the allowable level mainly from vehicular traffic. The other is the intense sound that exists in some workplaces like factories and traffic islands where there is a real danger of permanent physical damage.Prolonged exposure to excessive noise produces adverse physiological effects such as hypertension, annoyance, disturbance in sleep and deafness etc. The noise has so far not been regarded as a fatal pollutant because so far it was within limits. Except in industrial areas and big cities noise pollution was not prominent and hence generally remained ignored from being treated as an environment pollutant. With the increasing industrialization and commercialization of society and with consequential increase in noise producing automobiles and machines, noise has become a slow poison to mankind. It is a matter of thought that whether we should accept the increased noise as a price for progress, or should shun the new technological advance all together to lead scheduled life. The other better way is to devise and implement noise controlling techniques to reduce the adverse impacts of noise.


**Levels of Noise:**

The sound pressure of the faintest sound that can be heard by a normal healthy individual is about 20 micro-Pascal. The loudest sound produced by a Saturn rocket at the lift off stage is about 200 Pa. This large variation in sound pressure (varying from 20 µ Pa to 200 Pa) is usually avoided by expressing sound pressure on a scale based on the log of the ratio of the measured sound pressure and a reference standard pressure. Measurement on this scale is called levels.

 

The sound level (L) is thus represented as, L = log10 Q/Q0  (Bels)

                                           Where Q = Measured quantity of sound pressure or sound power or sound intensity.

                                                   Q0 = Reference standard quantity of sound pressure.

                                                 L = Sound level in Bels. A Bel is a large unit so for convenience it is divided into 10 subunits                                                                    called decibels (dB). So when sound level is expressed in decibels.

                                                     L = 10  log10 Q/Q0  (dB).

According to World Health Organization (WHO) a level of 45 dB is considered a safe noise level in a city. However, a noise level of 65 dB can be tolerable as per the international standards. A report from National Physical Laboratory (India) shows that there is an increase in the background noise level at the rate of 1 dB per year.
 

**The Nature of Sound:**

Sound is the sensation caused by a vibrating medium acting on the ear, but the term is usually applied to the vibration itself. The source of sound is most often some vibrating solid body like a string or a sheet which generates vibrations in the air, but it may be generated by vibrations of a gaseous medium, as such the air in a whistle or flute. The medium conveying it to the ear can be a gas (air) or a liquid. In which the vibrations are transmitted as a longitudinal wave motion, i.e successive compressions and rarefactions of the molecules.

​
**Power and Intensity:**

The output of a source is measured as the rate of energy flow (i.e. power) in units of Watts (W).

The average output of some sources in Watt are as shown in the table below.


                                                                      Sound Output

                                                        Conversational speech     10–5


In a conveying medium e.g. in air the strength of sound is usually measured as intensity, that is the density of energy flow rate through unit area in W/m2. When a point source emits sound uniformly in all directions in a free field, it spreads over the surface of a sphere of increasing radius. The amount of energy is distributed over a larger and larger area, therefore decreasing the intensity.

 

As per the inverse square law the intensity at a distance d meters shall be:

                   I = W/4Π d 2

         Where I = Intensity in W/m2

                W = Power of source in Watts Sound intensity I is related to root mean square sound pressure by the equation

                   I=P 2 rms  /ρV

    Where Prms = root mean square pressure in Pascals (Pa)

                  ρ = density of air or medium in which sound wave is traveling in Kg/m3

                  V = velocity of sound wave in m/s


**Sensitivity of Sound:**

The average person can hear frequencies from about 29 to 16000 Hz depending upon the age and other subjective factors. The lowest intensity perceived as a sound is 10–12 W/m2 and this is known as the standard ‘threshold of audibility’. The upper limit is the ‘threshold of pain’ at 1 W/m2. Vibration above this intensity would cause pain and can damage the human ear. 

​Levels of Noise and its Measurement:

The human ear has an inbuilt defense mechanism, its sensitivity decreases for higher intensity sounds. Actually, its response is proportionate to the logarithm of intensity. It is measured in decibels. The decibel is the logarithm of the ratio of the measure sound intensity and the reference intensity (audibility). The sound level L is thus represented as,

​
L = 10 Log10 I/I 0 (dB)

I = the measured intensity

I0 = referred intensity 

​

The following table shows the intensity and consequent sound levels for some cases:

Effects of Noise:

There is a bad effect of noise on human health depending upon the noise level, exposure time and the health conditions.

The effects of noise can be classified in the following ways:

(i) Psychological and physiological effects:- The noise of different levels has different psychological and physiological effects. The following table shows some of them.


                               Effects of Noise


Noise level                                                                              Effects


65 dB                               Noise may create annoyance up to this level, but it is only psychological (nervous effect). Above                                                           this level physiological effects such as mental and physical fatigue may occur.


90 dB                                           Many years of exposure to such noise level would cause permanent hearing loss.


100 dB                             With short period of exposure to this noise level the aural acuity may be impaired temporarily and                                                     prolonged exposure is likely to cause irreparable damage to the auditory organ.


120 dB                                                    Short exposure cause pain and other damages to human beings.


150 dB                                                               Causes instantaneous loss of hearing.

 

Actually the acceptance level of noise depends upon the state of mind and the expectation of a listener. A person can bear the monotonous sound in a sleeper coach of a train as high as 70 dB and sleep comfortably as he expects it and mentally prepared for it. The same person may get disturbed even by the ticking of a clock at 20 dB in his bedroom.


Adverse Effects of Noise:

​Effects on Human Body:

Function Exposure to noise is likely to bring about activation of sympathetic nervous system in a similar way as heat, cold, pain etc. One of the short time reactions is the change in blood circulation. The other effects on brain and other organs are the increased release of insulin in pancreas, increase in the secretion of oxitaxin and ADH from the posterior and it also decreases the detoxifying function of the liver including aromatic substances with carcinogenic effects. Long time noise can produce stomach ulcer, reduced flow of gastric juice and change in acidity neurosis, allergies and circulatory disease, abortion and other congenital defects in children, deafness etc.

Sleep Interference:

The main annoying effect of noise is the interruption on sleep. Sleep is a must and even one nights missed sleep may disturb us. One can become short tempered and weary. Noise can interfere with sleep even when the sleeping person is not awakened.

Effect on Working Efficiency:

It has been proved that the working efficiency reduces with increase in noise. Reduction in noise from 96 dB to 87 dB has increased the performance by 12%. Reduction of noise either by sound proofing or putting sound obstructing barriers improves the quality of work. It also reduces the industrial accidents. The noise affects communication signals, so reduction of noise increases the efficiency.

Effect on Wildlife:

Noise produces physiological effects on human as well as animal health. It has been surveyed that noise has adversely affected the wildlife of the country. It has been observed by the zoo authorities that animals particularly deer, lions, rhino etc. are the worst affected ones by the traffic noise. They become dull, inactive, lesser reproductive and ill. Even the migratory birds are reduced if there is noise. In the forests because of the human activity the noise increases and the animals like lion, tiger and elephants feel segmentation and their reproduction is automatically reduced.

Effects on Non-living Things:

Noise affects even the non-living things. High intensity noise may produce cracks into buildings. The noise and vibrations from machinery result in shattering of foundations, loosening of plaster and cracks in walls and house hold crockery.

Control of Noise Pollution:

​Though the noise cannot be totally eliminated but can be reduced by adopting certain measures. The basic principals of noise control are as follows.

Noise Control at Source:

In an industry to control the noise at source the machinery should be equipped by effective silencers, properly installed on the designed foundation and well maintained. Use of shock absorbing material, efficient flow technique, reducing fluid jet velocities, restricting sound producing area, reducing peak accelerations are some of the techniques of noise control at source. Use of guards, covers, enclosures and muffler systems, sealing all openings, use of proper cutting speeds and feed rate are other ways of noise reduction. The proper maintenance of machines by lubrication and timely replacement of bearings is the main thing required for the control of noise at source.

Noise Control along the Path:

The modification of sound path includes:

i. Use of solid high barriers to interrupt the direct transmission. Solid fences and high earth berms can be provided up to attenuation along the highways.

ii. Increasing distance between the source and the receiver.

iii. By planting trees. Trees are very good absorber of the sound and otherwise also very much useful as described earlier.

Noise Control at Receiving End:

To control the noise at receiver level following measures are adopted.

Double glazing windows in the building for improved sound proofing.

Gasketing and sealing door and windows openings.

Providing additional sound insulation for roofs and walls.

Isolate the operator from the noise.

By controlling hours of exposure to noise.

Use of personal protective devices like ear plugs, ear defenders, disposable ear plugs etc.


Other Ways of Noise Control:

Forming legislation for noise levels for various types of equipment, land use pattern, declaration of silence zone, restricting the use of loudspeakers are some of the ways of noise reduction. Actually, there are rules and regulations but their implementation is difficult without the co-operation of masses. Educating people about hazards of noise pollution and developing awareness at all levels can solve the problem. The social workers should come up to ban the use of bands, orchestras, D.Js in the marriages and other functions. The engineers should design the equipment with minimum noise. The industrialists have to install and maintain the equipment & machinery properly. The vehicle drivers should owe to restrict the use of horns of their vehicles unnecessarily. The students should owe to stop the use of crackers on festivals and other moments of joy. The demonstrations should be silent ones. Society in general can reduce the noise pollution if it really wants so.


Measurement of Noise:

Sound level meters are used to measure any type of sound under different conditions and for a variety of reasons. For such applications measurement technique is carefully selected and controlled to obtain valid and consistent results. The measurements are generally taken at the receivers level i.e. 1.2 m above ground (human ear position). The response of the meter depends upon the type of expected sound.  The primary components of a sound level meter are microphone, single conditioning electronics and some form of filtering and an analog or digital indicator. The microphone is most important as it converts acoustic signal into electrical signal. The microphone may be a carbon microphone, condenser microphone, piezoelectric microphone or moving coil electrodynamic microphone etc. A good microphone must produce minimum diffraction. This is made possible by keeping its dimensions small compared to the weave length of sound to be measured. Its output should not be affected by temperature, humidity, wind, atmospheric pressure and magnetic field. It should have low electrical noise and should have flat frequency response. The output should have no distortion. It should have high acoustic impedance and should be strong built.


**Conclusion:**

The noise level is increasing day by day in urban and rural both environments. It is detrimental in many ways and particularly for human health. It causes annoyance, irritation, headache, insomnia, fatigue, mental disorders, increased perspiration, nausea, high blood pressure, high pulse rate and other human ailments. All measures should be adopted to reduce the noise at source level. If it is not possible to cut down the noise then efforts should be made to reduce it in between, by say absorption by trees. Even then if the sound reaching the listener is higher then permitted, personal protection should be done by using ear plugs or dampeners. The duty hours should be such that prolonged exposure to noise is restricted. The cities should be planned in such a way that the heavy traffic is always bye passed and the other traffic should have a timely entry. The vehicles with distorted silencers should be heavily panelized. Overloaded trucks produce more noise. Use of horns should be limited and the pressure horns should be totally banned. Use of loudspeakers should be banned and all processions on the roads should be banned. Use of fire crackers making loud sound, on festivals and other events should be restricted by law, rather banning their production. Sound proofing should be done in factories and industries and offices. By adopting all these measures the aim of noise control can be achieved.
