**Demolition Safety:**
Demolition is a dangerous operation, often undertaken with minimal information, drawings or plans being available. Therefore a systematic approach to the conception, planning and implementation of the work is needed, together with good management control, so as to ensure that all risks are kept to a minimum. Whether demolition is required for a small building or for a complex factory site, you must be aware of the hazards and risks. These need to be identified, assessed and effectively controlled to reduce the potential for injury to persons and damage to property.
