ENVIRONMENTAL ACTS AND REGULATIONS:

Various Acts and regulations:

After knowing something about the various elements of environment, their dynamic interrelationship and the adverse effects of environmental pollution, one should work in the direction of adopting the pollution control strategies. For this, provision of Acts and regulations is a must in the present setup of the society. In the ancient system the environmental management was a part of life when consideration of animals like cows, dogs, cats etc., birds like sparrows, flamingo (KURAJA) peacocks etc. was there in day today life and they were treated as part of family. A small share of meals was contributed by every person/family and a voluntary adjustment existed in the Indian society structure. Trees and shrubs like Neem, People and Banyan, Tulsi etc. were worshiped like Gods and rivers were praised like Mother Goddesses. Sun was considered to be the prime source of energy and happiness and the daily routine was so adjusted to cater more and more energy through its radiations and using least amount of other means, like the valuable natural resources, coal, petroleum etc. Human and animal energy was used for transportation and the buildings were designed for natural daylighting, natural ventilation and least heating/cooling demands. This prevented the environment from being polluted but the present trend of living in nucleus families with self-centeredness, living away from nature, desire of more and more comforts has led the society to such an extent of consumerism that there is no

scope of environment protection. In this era it can be obtained only by imposing rules, regulations, acts, penalties and such other measures. There are so many regulations to be fulfilled by the individuals, entrepreneurs, industrialists, producers, consumers, society, nations and internationals.


International Concern for Environment:

The international concern for environment was first immersed in the United Nations Conference on Human Environment in Stockholm in June 1972 where a declaration was made that

(i) Man has the fundamental right to freedom, equality and adequate conditions of life in an environment of quality that permits a life of dignity and well being.

(ii) Man bears a solemn responsibility to protect and improve the environment for present and future generations.

This declaration was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in December 1972 and June 5 was declared as the World Environment Day. The conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe on August 1, 1975, announced that “Environmental protection was important both for the well being of the people and economic progress of the country”. An international conference on environmental education was held at New Delhi in Dec. 1982 stressing the need of formal and informal environmental education right from childhood.

AGENCIES FOR MAKING ENVIRONMENT LAWS & THEIR ENFORCEMENT IN INDIA: 
 
In 1972, a National Council of Environmental Planning and Coordination was set-up at the Department of Science and Technology. Another committee was set-up in 1980 for reviewing the existing legislations and administrative machinery for environmental protection and for recommending ideas to strengthen the existing laws and environmental agencies in India. In 1980, a separate Department of Environment was set-up which was upgraded to full-fledged Ministry of Environment and Forests in 1985.  

Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) of Government of India serves as the nodal agency for the planning, promotion, making of environment laws and their enforcement in India. Following are the other important agencies which help the MoEF in carrying out environment related activities:

1. Central Pollution Control Board

2. State Pollution Control Boards

3.State Departments of Environment

4. Union Territories (UT) Environmental Committees

5. The Forest Survey of India

6 .The Wildlife Institute of India

7 .The National Afforestation and Eco-development Board

8. The Botanical and Zoological Survey of India, etc.

Under these directives it is mandatory for every brick manufacture within a radius of 50 km from coal or lignite based thermal power plant to mix at least 25% of ash (fly ash/bottom ash/pond ash) with soil on weight-to-weight basis to manufacture clay bricks or tiles or blocks used in construction activities.  
Every coal or lignite based thermal power plant has to make available ash, for at least ten years from the date of publication of this notification, without any payment or any other consideration, for the purpose of manufacturing ash-based products.

XIV. THE BATTERIES (MANAGEMENT AND HANDLING (DRAFT) RULES), 2000.  

The MOEF issued the Batteries (M&H) (Draft) Rules, 2000 to control the hazard associated with backyard smelting and unauthorized reprocessing of lead acid batteries. The lead acid batteries are widely used automobiles such as cars, trucks, buses, two wheelers and inverters.
As per the provision, battery manufacturers, importers, assemblers and re-conditioned have to collect old batteries on a one to one basis against the sale of new batteries.  
The batteries so collect have to be sent to recyclers, registered with MOEF for recycling them in eco-friendly manner, unless battery manufactures them have such recycling facilities.  
Registration is accorded by the MOEF to only those units, which have in place appropriate manufacturing technology, pollution prevention systems and suitable arrangements for waste disposal.
Importers of new batteries, dealers as well as organization auctioning used batteries have been brought under the purview of these rules.  
Only those re-processors registered with MOEF would be able to participate in sale by auction or contract. As a result, middlemen and backyard smelters are debarred from participation in any auction within the country.  
Manufactures have to incorporate suitable provisions for buyback, in case of bulk sale of batteries by the manufacturers to bulk consumers.
Recycling of ferrous metals such as lead and zinc helps to save energy vis-à-vis primary metal production and is environment-friendly if reprocessing is done with suitable arrangements for pollution a control and waste disposal. They also help conserving precious metal resources.

DUTIES OF INDIAN CITIZEN:

Legislation's alone are not the remedy for environmental management, it is the responsibility of all the citizens to strive to protect the environment for the present and future generations since it is the fundamental duty of citizens to protect and conserve the environment as enshrined in our Constitution. Virtually, environmental legislation is essentially a social legislation since environmental degradation affects all of us. The criminal nature of pollution offences have to be viewed seriously. Environmental legislation provides the framework for punitive action against the offenders.
Conservation, recycle, and reuse are the current trends observed in the control of environmental pollution. Even though there may be law regarding these aspects scattered in different Acts of Indian legislation, there is a need for comprehensive Resource Conservation and Recovery Act today. It is not always necessary that Environmental degradation or danger should occur to implement the law. One should always take steps before such happenings.
The problem of environmental degradation is a complex one which requires multidimensional approach. There is dearth of environmental protection laws, but we need a firm hand to implement them. Environmental education can play an important role in negating the adverse impacts of pollution.
