**Chemical Safety**

**What are chemical substances:**

1. A chemical substance is a material with a specific chemical composition.
2. Water is an example of a chemical substance - it always has the same number of hydrogen and oxygen (e.g. H2O).
3. Some everyday chemicals include cleaning materials, cosmetics, plastics, paint, dyestuffs, sugar, solvents, etc.
4. A chemical substance can exist as a solid, liquid or gas and still be the same substance.
5. For example, water and steam are different forms of the same substance.

**Form of chemicals:**

1. Chemicals are present in every workplace.
2. Even in the cleanest, most modern office, employees may be routinely exposed to inks, toners and adhesives not to mention a wide range of chemicals used in cleaning and maintenance.
3. Chemicals can exist in many forms:
4. • Dust, fumes, fiber's, powders.
5. • Liquids.
6. • Gases, vapor's, mists.
7. Any chemical, in either gas, liquid or solid form, that has the potential to cause harm is referred to as a hazardous or dangerous chemical.
8. Such chemicals include those:
9. Brought directly into the workplace and handled, stored and used for processing e.g.: solvents, cleaning agents, glues, resins, paints.
10. Generated by a process or work activity e.g. fumes from welding/ soldering, dust from machining of wood, flour dust, solvents.
11. Generated as waste or residue e.g. fumes from soldering iron, carbon monoxide from engine or motor exhausts.
12. A wide range of chemicals are being used in Institute laboratories.
13. The hazards associated with these chemicals vary depending on their properties and mode of handling and usage.
14. Inherent hazards are also associated with the reactions that are carried out with these chemicals and the equipment being used.
15. The risks involved include serious injuries and adverse health effects.
16. This calls for utmost care in handling of chemicals from the time of receipt to disposal.
17. Prevention of mishaps requires a proactive approach in identifying hazards and putting control measures in place.

**Routes of Entry:**

1. The chemicals being handled can adversely affect the health of the person if it finds its way into the body.
2. This can happen either through the
3. Respiratory system by inhalation,
4. Skin absorption and
5. Ingestion
6. Among these three modes, the respiratory system is the main route of entry of chemicals into the body.

**Inhalation:**

1. Inhalation is the most common route of entry for chemicals into the body.
2. The vapours or fumes released from chemical containers or during the chemical reaction being carried out can enter the respiratory system if adequate precautions are not taken.
3. The impact on the respiratory system will depend upon the type of chemical, its properties, ambient concentration of the chemical and duration of exposure.
4. The chemical vapours can cause severe irritation of the respiratory tract or it can be absorbed into the blood stream to be carried to target organs.
5. The respiratory system has its own defense mechanism against foreign materials entering it.
6. The mucous secretion along the nasal cavity and millions of tiny hairs called cilia lining the respiratory tract help in expelling foreign material.
7. In addition to this, macrophage cells attack and expel the dust particles reaching the lower respiratory passages.
8. But these defense mechanisms are often overwhelmed when foreign materials enter the body in excess amounts.

**Skin absorption:**

1. Next to inhalation, absorption through the skin forms the main route of entry of chemicals into the body.
2. Absorption through the skin can happen when the chemical handled comes in contact with unprotected body parts.
3. This happens when the person handling the chemicals is not wearing appropriate clothing or personal protective equipment.
4. Cuts and abrasions on the skin can be a source of absorption of the chemical into the bloodstream.
5. Chemicals can also be absorbed through the intact skin.

**Gastrointestinal introduction of toxins:**

1. This route of entry of chemicals into the body is rare when compared to other means of entry.
2. Ingestion of the chemical can result from the consumption of food items inside the labs, contamination of food items stored in refrigerators meant for chemicals, mouth pipetting, and accidental ingestion of chemicals stored in drinking water bottles and poor personal hygiene.

**Types of chemicals:**

**Corrosives:**

1. Corrosives are chemicals which cause burns on the skin, mucous membrane and eyes.
2. Chemical burns are also caused when tissues come in contact with corrosive solids, corrosive liquids dispersed in the air as mists.
3. It includes mainly acids and alkalis.
4. Acid mists or fumes can corrode structural materials and equipment.
5. Corrosives chemicals have other dangerous properties as well.
6. For example, perchloric acid, in addition to being highly corrosive, is also a powerful oxidizing agent which can cause fire and explosions.
7. Facilities like emergency eyewash and shower must be available in the labs handling corrosives.
8. Splashing of corrosives into the eyes can result in partial or total loss of vision if not flushed with copious amount of water immediately.
9. Caustics can cause serious skin burns as they penetrate deep into the tissue.
10. Corrosive chemicals, both solid and liquid, can generate large amounts of heat when mixed with water.
11. This can cause the solution to boil or even erupt violently.
12. When water is added into a container of concentrated sulfuric acid it is converted instantly to steam which will eject the entire contents into the air.
13. To prevent this always add corrosives to water, slowly, in small amounts, with frequent stirring.
14. Always use personal protective equipment like safety goggles, face shields, chemical apron/coverall and hand gloves with long sleeves while handling corrosive chemicals.
15. Examples of corrosives include:
16. Nitric acid
17. Sulphuric acid
18. Calcium hydroxide
19. Hydrofluoric acid
20. Sodium hydroxide
21. Bromine

**Oxidisers:**

1. Oxidisers are a hazard as they support combustion.
2. Fires can burn violently in their presence.
3. Oxidisers must be stored away from flammables, since they can start a fire if they come in contact with each other.
4. Oxidizing materials which start to decompose at temperatures marginally above normal room temperatures must be stored well below their decomposition temperature.
5. Do not use sawdust or other combustible substances to clean up spills of oxidizing materials.
6. Examples of oxidisers include:
7. Nitric acid
8. Perchloric Acid
9. Permanganates
10. Nitrates
11. Perchlorates

**Flammables:**

1. Flammable chemicals are a fire hazard.
2. The lower the flashpoint (the lowest temperature at which a liquid fuel will give off enough vapour to form a momentarily ignitable mixture with air.) of the chemical, greater the hazard.
3. Flammable chemical bottles must not be kept open without caps.
4. They must not be kept near ignition sources.
5. They must not be left on the lab bench after use, but to be stored in safety cabinets after use.
6. A fire in a laboratory can easily get out of control if it involves any flammable solvents.
7. Flammable chemicals must not be kept open in beakers or containers as they readily release vapour.
8. The released vapours can form a flammable vapour air mixture which can ignite in the presence of a source of ignition.
9. Open flames must be prohibited where solvents are handled and stored.
10. The amount of solvent storage inside the labs must be only those required for immediate use.
11. Flammable chemicals must not be stored along with oxidisers.
12. Flammable chemical bottles or open containers with flammable chemicals must not be stored in domestic refrigerators.
13. The vapours released can be ignited by the lighting unit or the thermostat inside.
14. Intrinsically safe lab-purpose refrigerators must be used for the purpose of storing flammable chemicals.
15. Distillation of solvents must only be done inside a chemical fume hood.
16. Flammable chemicals must not be heated with Bunsen burners, use a water bath for the same.
17. Examples of flammable chemicals are:
18. Acetone
19. Toluene
20. Methyl alcohol

**Water Reactives:**

1. A violent reaction can occur if water reactive chemicals come in contact with water or moisture.
2. They must be stored away from wash areas or places where it can come in contact with water.
3. Some chemicals react with water to produce heat and flammable gases.
4. The bench must be kept dry in the vicinity of an experiment involving alkali metals.
5. The apparatus used must be free of moisture.
6. Examples are:
7. Sodium
8. Lithium
9. Potassium

**Pyrophorics:**

1. Pyrophorics are chemicals which undergo spontaneous ignition when they come in contact with air.
2. Handling and usage of pyrophorics require fire resistant lab coat, fire resistant hand gloves, safety glasses and face shield.
3. Experiments involving the same must only be carried out inside a fume hood.
4. Portable shields may also be used for additional protection.
5. Laboratories handling pyrophoric chemicals must have emergency eye wash fountain and shower and fire blankets.
6. At least two persons must be present in the laboratory whenever the pyrophoric chemical is handled.
7. Flammable solvents or other combustible substances must not be stored inside the fume hood when pyrophoric chemicals are being handled.
8. Handling of pyrophoric chemicals must always be done in an inert atmosphere.
9. Secondary containers (trays) must be used during handling and storage.
10. Examples are:
11. Butyl lithium
12. Diisobutylaluminium hydride

**Toxics:**

1. Toxic materials are substances that can cause harm to an individual if it enters the body.
2. Effects of toxic chemicals are of two types- acute and chronic.

**Acute effect:**

1. The ill effects appear during or immediately after a single exposure to a toxic chemical.
2. The health effects may be temporary, such as irritation of the skin, sickness, or they may be permanent: blindness, scars from acid burns, etc.
3. Acute toxicity is often seen within minutes or hours after a sudden, high exposure to a chemical.

**Chronic effect:**

1. The effects become visible after a long period of exposure.
2. This can vary from several weeks to years.
3. This results from multiple exposures to the toxic chemical in sufficient concentrations after a long period of time.

**Prevention of toxic exposures:**

1. Use the minimum quantity wherever possible.
2. The release of toxic vapours into the workplace must be prevented.
3. This can be achieved by carrying out the handling of toxic chemicals in fume hoods or using local exhaust ventilation system.
4. Personal exposure can be prevented by the use of personal protective equipment.

**LD50:**

1. LD stands for "Lethal Dose".
2. LD50 is the amount of a material, given all at once, which causes the death of 50% (one half) of a group of test animals.
3. It is used to measure the short term poisoning potential (acute toxicity) of a material.
4. It is expressed as the amount of chemical administered (e.g., milligrams) per 100 grams (for smaller animals) or per kilogram (for larger animals) of the body weight of the test animal.
5. The LD50 values are found for dermal and oral exposure.

**LC50:**

1. LC stands for "Lethal Concentration".
2. LC values denotes the concentration of a chemical in air.
3. The concentration of the chemical in air that kills 50% of the test animals in a given time is the LC50 value.
4. Lower the LD50/LC50 value, the more toxic is the chemical.

**Threshold Limit Values:**

1. Threshold Limit Values (TLV) refers to airborne concentrations of substances and represents an exposure level under which most people can work, day after day, without any adverse effect.
2. There are three categories of threshold TLVs:
3. Time Weighted Average (TLV-TWA) is the time weighted average concentration for a normal eight hour day or 40 hr week.
4. Nearly all persons can be exposed day after day to airborne concentrations at these limits without any adverse effect.
5. Short Term Exposure Limit (TLV-STEL) is the maximal concentration to which a person can be exposed for a period of upto 15 minutes continuously without any adverse effects.
6. Ceiling (TLV-C) is the concentration that must not be exceeded even for an instant.
7. TLV values are expressed in parts per million (ppm) or milligram per cubic meter (mg/m3).

**Peroxide forming chemicals:**

1. Peroxide forming chemicals reacts with oxygen in air to form unstable peroxides which may detonate violently when they become concentrated by evaporation or distillation or when subjected to unusual heat, shock or friction.
2. Preventing accidents involving peroxide forming chemicals involves
3. Detection and removal of peroxides,
4. Proper labeling of containers,
5. Recording the dates of receipts, usage and disposal,
6. Use of personal protective equipment,
7. Storing in airtight, amber glass bottles, preferably in the dark,
8. Disposal of the chemical as per the expiry date.
9. Containers must be protected from impact or physical damage when storing, transferring or using.
10. Diluting organic peroxides must be as per chemical suppliers's advice.
11. Using a wrong solvent or one that is contaminated can cause an explosion
12. Examples are:
13. Diethyl ether
14. Tetrahydrofuran
15. Isopropyl ether

3. The label must contain
4. The full name of the chemical,
5. Its hazards,
6. Information for safe handling and
7. The signage/pictogram indicating the hazard class.
8. Labels of bottles which got deteriorated or worn off must be replaced immediately.
9. Chemical bottles without labels or improper labeling can result in the wrong chemical being used.
10. Further it will also cause difficulty in case of a spill or body contact or at the time of disposal of the chemical.
11. Pictograms as per Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals created by the United Nations are as follows.

**Storage of chemicals:**

1. Storage must be as per the reactive class of the chemicals.
2. Incompatible chemicals must not be stored together.
3. Inventory of the chemicals must be checked at least annually.
4. Chemicals with expired shelf lives and deteriorated or leaking containers must be disposed of safely.
5. A 'first in, first out' system must be used.
6. The shelves used for storing the chemicals must be firmly fixed to the wall.
7. Rim guards must be fixed to prevent bottles falling from the edge.
8. Chemicals must not be stored near windows where they are exposed to sunlight.
9. Certain chemicals can undergo decomposition upon exposure to heat and it can also increase vapour pressure inside the bottle.
10. Bottles must not be kept on the floor along the passage or near exits, where they could be knocked over.
11. Chemical bottles must not be stored on higher racks of the shelf which are difficult to access.
12. Secondary containers (chemical resistant trays) must be used for storing and usage of chemicals.
13. This will help to contain the chemical in case of spill or breakage of bottle.
14. Corrosives must not be stored above eye level.
15. Keep the bottles tightly closed after usage.
16. Never return unused chemical to the original container, as it may contain traces of contamination of incompatible chemical which can cause a chemical reaction.
17. Do not reuse empty containers as it may contain residues of hazardous chemicals.

**Incompatible Chemicals:**

1. A wide variety of chemicals are used in laboratories and many of these can be incompatible with each other.
2. This can lead to serious injuries if they are not handled correctly.
3. Incompatible materials are a pair of substances which on coming in contact with each other produce a potentially harmful effect.
4. The mixing can result in a fire or explosion or can result in the release of toxic gases.
5. Examples include:
6. Acids and bases
7. Flammables and oxidisers
8. The mixing of incompatible chemicals can occur due to:
9. Breaking of two chemical bottles stored together during handling or fall of bottles from shelves,
10. washing of chemical bottles,
11. Improperly labelled chemical bottles,
12. Transferring spent chemicals.
13. Prevention of chemical accidents from mixing of incompatibles can be done by-
14. First identifying the incompatibles among the chemicals available in the laboratory.
15. Segregating them in different cupboards/shelves.
16. Secondary containers (trays) can be used for storing compatible chemicals.
17. Proper labeling of chemical bottles used in the laboratory.
18. Not to carry out unauthorized experiments.

**Hazard Control:**

1. Once the hazards involved in the handling and use of chemicals are identified, the next stage is to put control measures in place.
2. This includes,
3. Elimination- Options which get rid of the hazard altogether.
4. Substitution- Replacing a hazardous chemical with a less hazardous one wherever possible.
5. Engineering Controls- Fume Hoods, local exhaust ventilation, etc.
6. Administrative control- Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), caution signages, etc.
7. Personal protective equipments- Lab coats, safety glasses, hand gloves, etc.

**Fume Hood Usage:**

1. Be aware of the proper methodology of working with fume hood.
2. Do not store materials blocking the baffles.
3. If an equipment has to be placed, it must be kept on raised stands to allow free flow of air below.
4. Do not use perchloric acid in an ordinary hood.
5. A wash down hood must be used for handling of perchloric acid.
6. Keep all apparatus at least six inches inside from the sash.
7. Maintain good housekeeping in the hood at all times.
8. Clean up the hood and remove unwanted materials at the end of the work.
9. Avoid making rapid movements while operating the hood.
10. This may cause the vapours inside the hood to escape out.
11. The sash must be lowered and raised slowly.
12. Do not place electrical receptacles inside the hood.
13. A safety shield can be placed inside the hood as an additional precaution if there is a chance of runaway reaction.
14. Keep only materials required for immediate use inside the hood.
15. Never use fume hood as a place for storing chemical bottles or containers.
16. Flammable chemicals must not be stored inside the fume hood.
17. Use personal protective equipment while working with fume hood, depending upon the type of chemical used and its hazard.
18. Test the performance of the hood at least once in six months.
19. Face velocity test measures the velocity of the air as it enters the sash.
20. For fume hoods, the exhaust fan must be able to create a face velocity of 30 meters per minute at normal working height.
21. Those fume hoods handling highly toxic materials require higher face velocities of 45 meters per minute.
22. While operating the fume hood ensure that the sash is placed at the safe limit mark indicated on the fume hood.
23. Never put your head inside the fume hood or raise the sash above the safe limit while working.
24. Wherever possible avoid working while sitting opposite the fume hood.
25. As flying fragments of glass would be hurled out if there is a failure of equipment and if the sash is kept open.
26. Keep the sash of the fume hood closed while the fume hood is not in use.

**Local Exhaust Ventilation:**

1. Local exhaust ventilation helps to remove the vapours/gases/dusts from the point of generation before it reaches the breathing zone of the user.
2. A local exhaust ventilation system consists of
3. A hood or opening that captures the vapours/dust at the source,
4. Ducts that transfers the contaminant from the hood,
5. Fan/blower that discharges air outdoors and
6. An exhaust stack from which the contaminated air is discharged outside.
